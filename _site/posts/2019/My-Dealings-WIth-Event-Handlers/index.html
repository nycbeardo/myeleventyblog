  <h1>My Dealings with Event Handlers</h1> 
  <time datetime="2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z">August 30, 2019</time> 
  <p><em><strong>As you may or may not know,  I am currently on my journey to becoming better at JavaScript and React.</strong></em></p>
<p>This has been easy at times but harder as the topics get more complicated  and I continue to grow as a developer. One of
the topics that have been difficult but interesting is how Event Handlers are dealt with in React.</p>
<p><em><strong>To give a little bit of background info on this particular topic:</strong></em></p>
<!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p><em><strong>Event handlers help keep track of every action performed by the user.</strong></em></p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>*This can be anything from resizing a window, clicking on links, a page scrolling, all of which are processed by event handlers. *</p>
<h3>Things to keep in mind:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The naming of events in React are of great importance, and adding events is similar to how they are added to DOM elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synthetic events play a role, as they are needed to provide event details and can be passed into event handlers as well as callback functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining events using JSX: use the camelCase event with the handler or callback function as the property of the JSX that is a placeholder for the element in React.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My first exposure to event handlers came in the form of tutorials in the Learn ReactJS course on Codecademy.
While it was only a small preview, that part of the lesson gave me insight into updating parent and child components in React through the use of event handlers.
Continuing onward, I want to make sure that the concepts that I am being exposed to will help me in the implementation aspect when building new projects. I have a long way to go with becoming stronger in React, and while this topic was a challenge,
determining the logic behind it helped to broaden my understanding and increase my knowledge base.</p>
