  <p><em><strong>You may have heard the term Design Systems, or maybe other terms such as Design Language, Pattern Library,  or even Component Design.</strong></em></p>
<p>When we talk about Design Systems, we are actually referring to components that can be reused in a number of different combinations. This is very important when dealing with human computer interaction, user experience, interaction design, as well as frontend development.  Design Systems help with improving design and development workflow, iterate with confidence, and manage updates collaboratively. Documentation is also key to understanding the separate components that make up the design system along with when and how to use them effectively.</p>
