  <h1>Combating Racial Bias in UX Design</h1> 
  <time datetime="2020-08-13T00:00:00.000Z">August 13, 2020</time> 
  <!-- Excerpt Start -->
<p><em><strong>A look at how UX design can negate racism and promote positive impact</strong></em></p>
<!-- Excerpt End -->
<p>As you're well aware, this year has been unlike anything we could've imagined.
In the United States in particular, the pandemic give way to protests following the death of George Floyd and radical shift in the
national and global conversation about how society treats it's most vulnerable and marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Many companies and studios whose industries include tech and design,
which in the past have avoided or downplayed issues with race and diversity, found themseleves having to show some form of support</p>
<p>While in some cases it seemed genuine, most displays of solidarity were just that... displays.
Many had no comprehensive plan on how to combat the lack of diversity, the lack of opportunites for underrepresented groups, and lack of
diverse leadership.</p>
<h2>You may wonder why is that important or you may think its not a big deal. Well I got news for you, IT IS!</h2>
<p>When it comes to the creation of products and services for the web and how they are developed and designed, who is chosen to
take on the tasks of doing that is intentional and most likely have a skewed viewpoint of the world they live in.</p>
<p>Most of the time they are usually White and sometimes Asian, with no further representation of Black, Latinx, or Indigeneous People.</p>
<p>The decisions that places people of privilege in these positions can have consequences for users, the ones they have in mind and the ones they dont have in mind.</p>
<p>Consider how apps such as Nextdoor utilize a method known as anticipatory design. Sure it helps to make hard decisions super easy for the user in a way that gives them less to think about, but in the wrong scenario it could lead to an error of judgement and place someone traditionally powerless in society in real danger.</p>
<p>With that being said, how can we make changes to move in the right direction so that we use design as a tool for change and not to beef up the status quo or promote oppression?</p>
