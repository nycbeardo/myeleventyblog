It’s a minor update to JSON Feed, clarifying a few things in the spec and adding a couple new fields such as <code>authors</code> and <code>language</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For version 1.1, we&rsquo;re starting to move to the more specific MIME type <code>application/feed+json</code>. Clients that parse HTML to discover feeds should prefer that MIME type, while still falling back to accepting <code>application/json</code> too.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://jsonfeed.org/code/\">code page</a> has also been updated with several new code libraries and apps that support JSON Feed.</p>\n",
