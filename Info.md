<p>As a Frontend Technologist</span> based in Brooklyn NY, my areas of focus include interface design, JAMStack/SSG development, practical usage of CSS,
 generative art, and tech education for underrepresented groups.</p>
<br>
I believe in the idea that good design and accessible technology should be easy to use, provides a enjoyable experience and most importantly provides positive <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">social impact</span> in our communities.

<p>Embracing the idea of new methodologies along with understanding one another and <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">fair </span><span class="realistic-marker-highlight">collaboration</span> is crucial when it comes to the products and services we build</p> 
<p><span class="realistic-marker-highlight">Thoughtful</span> design and <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">equality</span> in tech are extremely important in today's ever connected world.</p>
<p>When I'm not building things, you can find me engaging with other techies on the web, at meetups, roaming in the woods, or looking for the next great thing to eat or listen to.</p>
