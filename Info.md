<My>I'm a passionate frontend engineer with a penchant for crafting artistic and highly functional designs that not only captivate but also elevate user experiences. With a keen eye for detail and a love for pushing the boundaries of creativity, I thrive on bringing visions to life through code. My areas of focus include interface design, JAMStack/SSG development, practical usage of CSS, generative art, and tech education for underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>My journey in web development has been fueled by a deep-seated fascination with the intersection of technology and design. From sleek interfaces to immersive user interactions, I relish the challenge of translating ideas into seamless digital experiences.</p>

<p>Collaboration is at the heart of what I do. I believe in the power of teamwork and synergy to produce truly remarkable results. Whether it's partnering with other developers or collaborating with creative studios, I'm always eager to join forces and bring collective visions to fruition.</p> 
<br>
<p>When I'm not building things, you can find me engaging with other techies on the web, at meetups, roaming in the woods, or looking for the next great thing to eat or listen to.</p>
