<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<br>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<br>
<p>As a <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">Creative Technologist</span> based in New York City, my passions/areas of focus include <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">web development,</span> 
 creative coding, interface design, and tech design education for underrepresented groups.</p>

<h2>Credence</h2>
<br>
I believe in the idea that good design and accessible technology that is easy to use, provides a enjoyable experience and most importantly has <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">social impact</span> for society at large.

<p>In addition, I embrace the idea of new methodologies as well as understanding one another and <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">fair collaboration</span> is crucial when it comes to the products and services we build</p> 

<p>Thoughtful design and <span class="realistic-marker-highlight">equality in tech</span> are extremely important in today's ever connected world.</p>

When I'm not building things, you can find me engaging with other techies on the web, at meetups, roaming in the woods, or looking for the next great thing to eat or listen to.
