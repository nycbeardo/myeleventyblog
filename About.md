<h1 id="about">About</h1>
  
As a Design centric developer based in New York City, my passions/areas of focus include digital art, information design, usability testing, and tech design ed for underrepresented groups.

I believe in advocating for good design and technology that is easy to use, provides a enjoyable experience and most importantly has good social impact for society at large.

In addition I believe in promoting new methodologies as well as understanding one another and fair collaboration is crucial when it comes to the products and services we build. Thoughtful design and equality in tech and design are extremely important in today's ever connected world.

When I'm not building things, you can find me engaging with other techies on social media, going to meetups, enjoying nature, and/or looking for the next great thing to eat and write about on my food blog
