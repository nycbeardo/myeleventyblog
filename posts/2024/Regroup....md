<!-- Excerpt Start -->
***How we go about resuming our journey determines who we become***
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Having to restart something that you love again after a personal tragedy is something most people can relate to. 
It makes us human to grieve, to ponder on what is or isnt anymore. These things can and will happen in various stages of our lives. How we go about resuming our journey determines who we become.

With that being said I am resuming the learning part of my journey and plan to write more about the things I am building, new concepts, and where I'm drawing creativity from, which you can see a list of on the home page.

And in the spirit of it being Friday, I leave you with a few of the things on the web that have caught my eye:
